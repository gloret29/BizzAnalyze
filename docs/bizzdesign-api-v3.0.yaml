     <small>Please note that this document refers to <i>data blocks</i>, which is the new term for what was previously referred to as <i>documents</i>. Similarly, the term <i>schema</i> was superseded by <i>data block definition</i></small><p>Bizzdesign Enterprise Studio allows invited users to collaboratively model architectural structural objects, store these on Horizzon, and publish them to selected user groups.<br><br> Part of this collaborative process is managing a set of properties for each modeled object. Property values are assigned in Enterprise Studio, and stored with the object on Horizzon. Horizzon will display their values with the object, but does not allow changing them.</p> <p>This API allows clients to:<ul><li>extend and enrich architectures managed by the Bizzdesign toolset</li> <li>set up data policies to manage the access to and maintenance of data blocks</li> <li>retrieve Horizzon event log information</li></ul></p> <h3><u>Data enrichment</u></h3><p>On top of these read-only properties Horizzon supports additional object attributes of which the values can be edited in Horizzon and in Enterprise Studio. These attributes are defined in a <i>data block definition</i>, of which instances (aka <i>data blocks</i>) can be attached to architectural structural elements. This API allows an authorized client application to directly create, modify and delete data block definitions and data blocks, enriching the architecture with additional data.</p><h3><u>Architecture automation</u></h3><p>The architecture managed by the Bizzdesign toolset can also be extended with architectural elements that are managed outside of this toolset. This API allows an authorized client application to add <i>collections</i> of <i>entities</i> and <i>links</i> from an external source, and incorporate them seamlessly in an architecture managed in Enterprise Studio. These entities themselves can be assigned additional properties using data enrichment.</p><small>Please note that all calls to this API may be subject to <i>rate limiting</i>, causing them to return a 429 status code (&quot;Too Many Requests&quot;). </small><h3><u>Data policies</u></h3><p>Data policies are used to define rules for accessing and maintaining the content of a data block. This allows users and groups with the contributor role to be assigned as <i>editors</i> for data blocks as well as users and groups with the consumer role to be assigned as <i>readers</i> for data blocks. Optionally, data blocks can also be assigned an <i>update schedule</i> which will generate periodic <i>data tasks</i> prompting editors to maintain that data block.</p> <h4>Editors and Readers</h4> <p>Users and groups may be assigned as <i>editors</i>, which will allow them to view and modify data block content, or as <i>readers</i>, which will allow them to only view data block content. This API allows assigning editors and readers at the model level for a specific object type and a specific data block definition, or at the object level for a specific data block data definition. Editors and readers assigned at object level override those set at model level.</p> <h4>Update schedules</h4> <p>A data block may be assigned a schedule that indicates when and how often the content of the data block should be updated by its editors. When a schedule is assigned, <i>data maintenance</i> workflows will be created within the system, and <i>data tasks</i> will be generated that prompt the editors to verify and update the contents of the data block.</p><h3><u>Audit event logging</u></h3><p>Important events in Horizzon are logged and stored for easy retrieval and inspection. These include system events, external events, and user-generated events. The Open API can be used to access the Horizzon events audit log information.</p>

tags:
- name: repository
  description: A <b>repository</b> hosts a <i>model package</i> (aka 'master' collaboration), <i>projects</i> based on this model package (if applicable), and <i>collections</i> (if applicable). A collection is available in all collaborations in the repository. Note that projects are not available in this API, the objects managed by Enterprise Studio in the repository are the objects of the model package.
- name: objects
  description: An <b>object</b> represents any object in a repository, for example a <i>model</i>, <i>scheme</i>, <i>element</i> or <i>relation</i> (managed in Enterprise Studio in the model package in the repository), or <i>collection</i>, <i>container</i>, <i>entity</i> or <i>link</i> (managed outside of Enterprise Studio). The endpoints in this section take <i>internal IDs</i> to address an object, even for those that have an <i>external ID</i> assigned to them.
- name: data block definition
  description: A <b>data block definition</b> describes a group of attributes that can be instantiated (as a <i>data block</i>) and linked to an <i>object</i>. It is applicable to a single <i>repository</i>, and identified using a <i>namespace</i> and <i>name</i>.
- name: data block
  description: A <b>data block</b> is a group of attribute values that conforms to a <i>data block definition</i> and is associated with an <i>object</i>.
- name: collection
  description: A <b>collection</b> is home to objects managed outside of Enterprise Studio, and is equivalent to a <i>model</i> in Enterprise Studio managed architecture. The endpoints in this section use <i>IDs</i> to address collections, which can either be an <i>internal ID</i> or <i>external ID</i>.
- name: container
  description: A <b>container</b> is a subdivision of a <i>collection</i>, equivalent to a <i>scheme</i> in Enterprise Studio managed architecture. It contains entities belonging to a specific domain, and links. The number of objects in a container is limited to 5000. The endpoints in this section use <i>IDs</i> to address containers, which can either be an <i>internal ID</i> or <i>external ID</i>.
- name: entity
  description: An <b>entity</b> represents a structural element, and is equivalent to an <i>element</i> in Enterprise Studio managed architecture. The endpoints in this section use <i>IDs</i> to address entities, which can either be an <i>internal ID</i> or <i>external ID</i>.
- name: link
  description: A <b>link</b> represents a relationship between two <i>entities</i>, or an <i>entity</i> and an <i>object</i>. It is equivalent to a <i>relation</i> in Enterprise Studio managed architecture. The number of links attached to an entity is limited to 500. The endpoints in this section use <i>IDs</i> to address links, which can either be an <i>internal ID</i> or <i>external ID</i>.
- name: entity data block
  description: The endpoints in this section allow the retrieval, creation, update, and deletion of <i>data blocks</i> on <i>entities</i>. Unlike the endpoints in the <i>objects</i> section, the endpoints in this section use <i>IDs</i> to address entities, which can either be an <i>internal ID</i> or <i>external ID</i>.
- name: link data block
  description: The endpoints in this section allow the retrieval, creation, update, and deletion of <i>data blocks</i> on <i>links</i>. Unlike the endpoints in the <i>objects</i> section, the endpoints in this section use <i>IDs</i> to address links, which can either be an <i>internal ID</i> or <i>external ID</i>.
- name: bulk
  description: The endpoints in this section allow creating, updating, and deleting multiple entities or links at once. They use <i>IDs</i> to address these objects, which can either be an <i>internal ID</i> or <i>external ID</i>.
- name: editor
  description: <b>Editors</b> are users or groups that are allowed to view and modify data blocks. They can be assigned at the model level for a specific object type and a specific data block, or at the object level for a specific data block. Editors assigned at object level override those set at model level.<p><i>(Please note that by default only a maximum of 8 users and/or groups may be assigned as editors per data policy. If this limit is exceeded, a 400 "Bad Request" status code will be returned.)</i></p>
- name: reader
  description: <b>Readers</b> are users or groups that are allowed to view data blocks. They can be assigned at the model level for a specific object type and a specific data block, or at the object level for a specific data block. Readers assigned at object level override those set at model level.<p><i>(Please note that by default only a maximum of 8 users and/or groups may be assigned as readers per data policy. If this limit is exceeded, a 400 "Bad Request" status code will be returned.)</i></p>
- name: data update schedule
  description: A <b>data update schedule</b> defines when and how often data blocks should be updated. A start date and a repeat pattern is specified for a given data block on a given object.
    Once created, data tasks will be assigned to all editors of the given data block.<p><i>(Please note that there may be a limit to the number of schedules that can be stored, depending on the system configuration. If this limit is exceeded, a 403 "Forbidden" status code will be returned, detailing the exact limit.) </i></p>
- name: audit events
  description: Horizzon keeps track of important events in an <b>audit log</b>. Audit events can only be retrieved by Open API clients with <i>admin</i> permissions.
